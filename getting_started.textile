Singleshot is developed against Rails 2.3.2.  Make sure to have Rails 2.3.2 installed:

<pre>
$ gem update --system
$ gem install rails -v 2.3.2
</pre>

To get the latest copy:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/intalio/singleshot.git
</pre>

You will need MySQL. The file @config/databases.yml@ contains the connection configurations for the development, test and production environment. You can either setup MySQL databases to match this configuration, or change it to suit your database setup. Remember that we're using three different databases for development, testing and production -- if in doubt, you're probably running against the production database. Also, you need to give Singleshot sufficient priviledges to load a new database schema.


To setup you development environment, specifically installing all the necessary dependencies and setting up the development and test databases, run the script @script/setup@:

<pre>
$ ruby script/setup
</pre>

This will also create a default account using your user name and the password 'secret'

To get started:

<pre>$ ruby script/server</pre>

Point your browser to "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 and login with your user name and password.

If you're using "Phusion Passenger":http://www.modrails.com/ you can setup an Apache virtual host like this:

<pre>
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName singleshot.local
  DocumentRoot "/Users/assaf/work/singleshot/public"
  RailsEnv development
  <directory "/Users/assaf/work/singleshot/public">
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </directory>
</VirtualHost>
</pre>

Then just add "singleshot.local":http://singleshot.local to your @/etc/hosts@ and you can use this handy URL.
